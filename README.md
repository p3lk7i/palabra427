## 1. Introduction

Palabra DDL is a **hierarchical, level-based, schema-free data definition language**. It belongs to the same family as JSON and YAML.
It is designed to represent tree-structured data in a **compact, human-readable, and machine-parseable format**.  


Key features:

- **Schema-free:** Users can define any keys at any depth.  
- **Hierarchical:** Structure is determined by numeric levels.  
- **Flexible:** Works for AI tech trees, personal profiles, configurations, or any nested data.  
- **Whitespace-safe:** Numeric levels replace indentation.

## 2. Syntax

Each line has the format: [level:key]value

- `level` → Numeric depth (≥1)  
- `key` → Optional identifier (can be empty)  
- `value` → Optional string  
- Level `N` must follow a parent at level `N-1`  
- Repeated keys are allowed  
- Empty values are allowed  
- Optional comments start with `//`

# Why Palabra (PLB) DDL is for you ?

## 1. Human-Readable
- Instead of complex braces, commas, or indentation rules, you just use `[level:key]value`.  
- Even someone new to your language can quickly understand the hierarchy.

## 2. Flexible
- You can describe anything: people, cars, AI tech trees, HTTP requests, etc.  
- Keys and values are free-form, so users can adapt it to any domain.

## 3. Hierarchical and Structured
- Each level number clearly indicates parent-child relationships.  
- Lists are naturally represented by repeated keys at the same level.  
- It’s easy to parse and visualize.

## 4. Lightweight
- Minimal punctuation and rules.  
- Very compact compared to JSON or XML.  
- Easy to write by hand or generate programmatically.

## 5. GitHub-Friendly
- With proper code blocks and indentation, your examples render beautifully on GitHub.  
- Makes it perfect for specifications, demos, or structured examples.
